Hello!

This small C++ program is designed to one who will do 10 pull-ups, 10 push-ups, 10 Squats and 10 Sit-ups.

One might be surprised how much, so little exercise this little effort everyday brings to the table.

If you do the math you'll realise tht after a month you would have done.

10 * 30 = 300 <br>
10 * 30 = 300 
10 * 30 = 300 
10 * 30 = 300 
Total = 1200 reps.

Through a whole year that is approx: 1200*12 = 14.400 reps!

And this will take as little as 2 minutes a day. If you avoid to make the exercises sequentially, but spread them out throughout the day,
you will not get sweaty either, and therefore you don't have to instantly shower. (Obviously you should shower anyways every day).
